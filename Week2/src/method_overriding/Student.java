	/*
	 * • A class that can inherit properties and methods from other class. Instance
	 * variables and methods* 
	 * • Interviewer: Constructor is never inherited. Each
	 * class has their own constructor. 
	 * • A class becomes a superclass or a parent
	 * class if it's being inherited. 
	 * • A class that inherits from a parent class is
	 * called a subclass.
	 * • The purpose of inheritance is so that we don't need to re-write properties and methods that we want in our child class. We can just use the inherited properties and methods from the parent. 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * !!! IMPORTANT !!!
	 * -----------------
	 * • Inheritance is a concept of IS-A-RELATIONSHIP
	 * • Method overriding is associated with inheritance.
