 * Tasks:
Make an Employee class. Make it a child class of Person.
Inside Employee class. Make extra methods and properties that relates to what an employee would have.
Create a constructor similar to Student class. Donâ€™t forget to call your super() powers :wink:
For example, employee should have a salary and an employee ID. Maybe have a method that creates an address (Aheem HINT)
Display method anyone? Maybe calculate method (overriding)? Inside calculate method add maybe some bonuses, be generous to your employee
